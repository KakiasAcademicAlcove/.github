# PhD Student Resources
## Applying for a PhD
To apply for a PhD under my supervision, please follow these steps:

1. **Get in touch to discuss**: Reach out to me via email or by [booking my calendar directly](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/90ad647b2ee3423ea75829c521f69bfd@UOS.AC.UK/meetingtype/LDsa_BznLkKkQCJbf0jmLQ2?bookingcode=4076a5c5-d72f-4a63-8b58-09ad0d65c431&anonymous&ep=mlink) to discuss your research interests and ideas and further refine the project on a topic of common interest.

Don't worry if you do not fulfil all the criteria or if you have had a long career break. At the University of Suffolk, we pride ourselves in supporting our students and ensuring that we support them to pursue their academic and learning goals. A postgraduate taught degree (MSc or MA) is not a prerequisite to getting accepted on our PhD programmes and you will most certainly be able to bring in industry experience and other relevant experience to this journey.

2. **Prepare Your Documents**: Ensure you have all necessary documents, including your CV, academic transcripts (from previous studies), and research proposal. Don't know how to get started? Have a look at this workbook [link]

Now is also a good time to get in touch with 2 of your referees in industry and education who might be able to write a supportive statement for you.

3. **Submit Your Application**: Complete the online application form on the University of Suffolk's website [link] and email your documents to the Suffolk Doctoral School.
   
5. **Interview**: If your application is shortlisted, you will be invited for an interview to discuss your research proposal and suitability for the program to a panel of 3 academics, including myself as your supervisor.

## Drafting your Research Proposal
A strong research proposal is crucial for your PhD application. Here are some tips to help you draft a compelling proposal:
1. **Identify a Research Gap**: Clearly define the problem you intend to address and explain why it is significant. 
2. **Literature Review**: Summarize existing research related to your topic and highlight how your research will contribute to the field.
3. **Research Methodology**: Describe the methods you will use to conduct your research, including data collection and analysis techniques.
4. **Expected Outcomes**: Outline the potential impact of your research and how it will advance knowledge in your field.
5.
