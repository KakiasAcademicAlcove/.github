# PhD Student Resources


## Available Support and resources for PhD students 


## Local Information
The University of Suffolk offers a comprehensive range of support services to help students thrive both academically and personally. All students can benefit from the “Preparing to Start” resources, which provide essential information to kickstart their university journey. International students have additional guidance through the “Getting Ready for Suffolk” program and must complete “Right to Study Checks” to ensure a smooth transition. The university’s “Campus Map” and information on “Staff and Student Car Parks” make navigating the campus easier. For those seeking accommodation, the university offers various options to suit different needs. The “Student Hub” is a central resource for all aspects of student life, ensuring that everyone has access to the support they need.
