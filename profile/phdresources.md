# PhD Student Resources

## About the PhD
Welcome to the PhD programme at the University of Suffolk. Our program is designed to foster innovative research and provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their academic and professional careers. 

Working closely with academics from the [Digital Futures Institute](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/research-institutes/digital-futures-institute/) and the [Suffolk Sustainability Institute](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/research-institutes/suffolk-sustainability-institute-ssi/), and supported by our commended [Suffolk Doctoral College](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/phd-study-and-the-suffolk-doctoral-college/suffolk-doctoral-college/), you will benefit greatly from interactions with scholars in disciplines close to your interests and make a valued contribution to our emergent research community. Dr. Chatsiou's expertise in machine learning, information management systems, and data science ensures a rich and supportive research environment.

We work in partnership with the [University of Brighton](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/research/postgraduate-research-degrees/index.aspx) to provide PhD courses in a range of research areas, as we are still working towards our [Research Degree Awarding Powers (RDAPs)](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/ofs-publishes-new-guidance-on-degree-awarding-powers/) as a university. We are hoping to gain awarding powers in the next years - depending on your enrollment date, you will be offered the option of graduating with a PhD from the University of Brighton or the University of Suffolk.
