# PhD Student Resources

## About the PhD
Welcome to the PhD programme at the University of Suffolk. Our program is designed to foster innovative research and provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their academic and professional careers. 

Working closely with academics from the [Digital Futures Institute](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/research-institutes/digital-futures-institute/) and the [Suffolk Sustainability Institute](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/research-institutes/suffolk-sustainability-institute-ssi/), and supported by our commended [Suffolk Doctoral College](https://www.uos.ac.uk/our-research/phd-study-and-the-suffolk-doctoral-college/suffolk-doctoral-college/), you will benefit greatly from interactions with scholars in disciplines close to your interests and make a valued contribution to our emergent research community. Dr. Chatsiou's expertise in machine learning, information management systems, and data science ensures a rich and supportive research environment.

We work in partnership with the [University of Brighton](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/research/postgraduate-research-degrees/index.aspx) to provide PhD courses in a range of research areas, as we are still working towards our [Research Degree Awarding Powers (RDAPs)](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/press-and-media/ofs-publishes-new-guidance-on-degree-awarding-powers/) as a university. We are hoping to gain awarding powers in the next years - depending on your enrollment date, you will be offered the option of graduating with a PhD from the University of Brighton or the University of Suffolk.

## Applying for a PhD
To apply for a PhD under my supervision, please follow these steps:

1. **Get in touch to discuss**: Reach out to me via email or by [booking my calendar directly](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/90ad647b2ee3423ea75829c521f69bfd@UOS.AC.UK/meetingtype/LDsa_BznLkKkQCJbf0jmLQ2?bookingcode=4076a5c5-d72f-4a63-8b58-09ad0d65c431&anonymous&ep=mlink) to discuss your research interests and ideas and further refine the project on a topic of common interest.

Don't worry if you do not fulfil all the criteria or if you have had a long career break. At the University of Suffolk, we pride ourselves in supporting our students and ensuring that we support them to pursue their academic and learning goals. A postgraduate taught degree (MSc or MA) is not a prerequisite to getting accepted on our PhD programmes and you will most certainly be able to bring in industry experience and other relevant experience to this journey.

2. **Prepare Your Documents**: Ensure you have all necessary documents, including your CV, academic transcripts (from previous studies), and research proposal. Don't know how to get started? Have a look at this workbook [link]

Now is also a good time to get in touch with 2 of your referees in industry and education who might be able to write a supportive statement for you.

3. **Submit Your Application**: Complete the online application form on the University of Suffolk's website [link] and email your documents to the Suffolk Doctoral School.
   
5. **Interview**: If your application is shortlisted, you will be invited for an interview to discuss your research proposal and suitability for the program to a panel of 3 academics, including myself as your supervisor.

## Drafting your Research Proposal
A strong research proposal is crucial for your PhD application. Here are some tips to help you draft a compelling proposal:
1. **Identify a Research Gap**: Clearly define the problem you intend to address and explain why it is significant. 
2. **Literature Review**: Summarize existing research related to your topic and highlight how your research will contribute to the field.
3. **Research Methodology**: Describe the methods you will use to conduct your research, including data collection and analysis techniques.
4. **Expected Outcomes**: Outline the potential impact of your research and how it will advance knowledge in your field.
